Version 1.0

Description
-----------
This keyboard implements the Cyrillic script for the Central Siberian Yupik language (ess-Cyrl). The earlier Yupik Cyrillic (SIL) Keyboard implemented a non-standard Cyrillic layout more familiar to English-speakers that had been introduced into the SIL language project around 1990. It is based on the Russian Basic keyboard, version 1.1.
